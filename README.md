## 🍔DrivenEats-Project

DrivenEats is a mobile-friendly food ordering application developed as part of a coding challenge. The goal was to replicate the provided Figma design, ensuring pixel-perfect implementation, accurate styling, and interactive functionality.

## 🚀 *Technologies Used*

- *HTML5* – For semantic and structured markup  
- *CSS3* – For styling and layout  
- *JavaScript* – For dynamic interactions  
- *Google Fonts (Righteous & Roboto)* – Ensuring consistent typography 

## 🎯 *Requirements Met*

- ✅ *Mobile-First Layout* – Designed primarily for mobile screens
- ✅ *Fixed Header and Checkout Button* – Ensuring a consistent UX  
- ✅ *Horizontal Scrolling for Food Items* – Implemented using  overflow-x: scroll  
- ✅ *Dynamic Item Selection* – Selecting one item per category with visual feedback  
- ✅ *Checkout Button Activation* – Becomes active only when all categories are selected  
- ✅ *Order Confirmation Window* – Displays order details before final submission  
- ✅ *WhatsApp Order Submission* – Redirects users to WhatsApp with a pre-filled order message  
- ✅ *Encapsulation of UI Behavior* – Using JavaScript functions for modularity  
- ✅ *WhatsApp API Integration* – Message formatting with  encodeURIComponent()  
- ✅ *Price Formatting* – Ensures two decimal places with  toFixed(2)  
- ✅ **CSS Shadows (box-shadow)** – Applied to navigation bar, food cards, and confirmation modal

## ✨ How to View the Project

This is a front-end project (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). To view its interactive features in your browser, you have a few options:

1.  **Download and Open Locally:**
    * **Clone the repository:**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ClaraDev01/Projeto-DrivenEats.git
        ```
    * **Navigate to the project directory:**
        ```bash
        cd DrivenEats-Project
        ```
    * **Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.** You can do this by dragging the `index.html` file into the browser window or by double-clicking it. Note that some interactive features (like WhatsApp API calls) might have limitations when opened directly without a local server due to browser security policies.

2.  **Use a Local Server Extension (Recommended for Development and Full Functionality):**
    * If you use **VS Code**, you can install the **Live Server** extension.
    * With the extension installed, open the project in VS Code, right-click on the `index.html` file, and select "Open with Live Server". This will start a local server and open the project in your browser, with all interactive features fully operational and live reloading.

3.  **Host on Free Services (Like GitHub Pages):**
    * You can host this project for free using **GitHub Pages**. Simply configure GitHub Pages to serve content from the `main` (or `master`) branch of your repository. GitHub will then generate a public link for your site (e.g., `https://YourUsername.github.io/DrivenEats-Project/`).
